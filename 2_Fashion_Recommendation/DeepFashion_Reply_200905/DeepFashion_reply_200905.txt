Hi,

Thank you for your interest in our work! The DeepFashion dataset is now officially released at: http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/DeepFashion.html , and can be downloaded from: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7EVK8r0v71pQ2FuZ0k0QnhBQnc (Google Drive) or https://pan.baidu.com/s/1PwJq0U2UPBWKkZvOR2lefQ (Baidu Drive).

Five benchmarks are developed using the DeepFashion database, including 'Attribute Prediction', 'In-shop Clothes Retrieval', 'Consumer-to-shop Clothes Retrieval', 'Landmark Detection' and 'Fashion Synthesis'.

The image zip file passwords are listed as follows:
  - In-shop Clothes Retrieval Benchmark: mmlab_DeepFashion_inshop
  - Consumer-to-shop Clothes Retrieval Benchmark: mmlab_DeepFashion_consumer2shop
  - Fashion Synthesis Benchmark: mmlab_DeepFashion_fashionsynth

Note that the data and labels of the 'Attribute Prediction Benchmark' and 'Landmark Detection Benchmark' are released without encryption.

More useful labels, annotations, and evaluation results for each benchmark will be released soon.

Enjoy and please feel free to feed back in case of any question!

Best,
DeepFashion team
